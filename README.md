🚀 As a student, I'm always exploring new ideas, honing my skills, and collaborating on interesting projects. My GitHub repository is a snapshot of this journey, showcasing a mix of personal projects, assignments, and contributions to open-source initiatives. I believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge sharing, and I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for innovation and creativity.

🌱 My interests span across AIML, Robotics Developing and Designing, and I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and contribute to meaningful projects. Whether it's experimenting with cutting-edge technologies or diving into the intricacies of problem-solving, I'm always up for a challenge.
